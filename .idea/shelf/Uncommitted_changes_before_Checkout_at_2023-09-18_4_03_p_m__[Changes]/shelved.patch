<+># Lab 2: Branching and Merging\r\n\r\nThe main topic of this first lab activity is branching and merging in git.\r\n\r\n## Resources and Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nhttps://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches contains an excellent, detailed\r\nwalkthrough of the steps we will be going through in the lab. We encourage you to use\r\nit as a reference as needed. The short video (about 4 minutes) is well worth a quick view\r\nin the link above.\r\n\r\nThe first coding part in this activity is (very loosely) based on a common problem encountered in\r\nproblems posted on https://projecteuler.net/archives which is another interesting source of challenging\r\nprogramming problems. You might also recognize that the multiples of 3 and 5 problem from\r\nlast week came from there. If you are looking for challenges, definitely check it out.\r\n\r\nThe partial cake recipes are courtesy ChatGPT.\r\n\r\n# TASK 0: Fork this repo\r\n\r\nNote: If you are in lab, your TA will share a different URL for you to fork from, so that you\r\ncan make pull requests to that repo during the Task 3 activity during the lab.\r\n\r\nDuring lab, you should not fork directly from https://github.com/CSC207-2023F-UofT/Lab2.\r\nIf you miss the lab and work on this after, you should use this URL though.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make a fork of this repo and clone a local copy (as you did in Lab 1).\r\n  - Important: make sure to uncheck the option to only fork the main branch, as the repo\r\n  contains some branches you will use in this lab.\r\n\r\n# TASK 1: Your first branch\r\n\r\n- [X] Create and checkout a new branch called `task_1` using either IntelliJ or the Terminal:\r\n  - IntelliJ: `Git -> New branch...`\r\n  - Terminal: `git checkout -b task_1`\r\n  - After, you can check `git status` or the Log tab of the Git tool window in IntelliJ to see\r\n  that you are now on the `task_1` branch.\r\n- [X] Open the TODO tool window (`View -> Tool Windows -> TODO`) and click on the TASK 1 TODO listed.\r\n- [X] Complete the TASK 1 TODO and commit your changes to this file (checking off the\r\ncompleted items so far) and `DataTypes.java` (remove the word TODO and your bug fix).\r\n  - talk to those around you or your TA, then see the hints at the bottom of the readme if you get stuck.\r\n- [X] Now, we'll merge the `task_1` branch back into `main`. When merging,\r\nyou need to be currently on the branch you are trying to merge into, so we'll first checkout the main\r\nbranch:\r\n  - IntelliJ: `Git -> branches... -> main -> Checkout`\r\n  - Terminal: `git checkout main`\r\nNote: everything we've done has been local to our repository and have not pushed anything yet.\r\n- [X] We are back on `main`, so we can now do the merge and complete our work!\r\n  - IntelliJ: `Git -> Merge... -> task_1 -> Merge`\r\n  - Terminal: `git merge task_1`\r\n\r\nYou should now see the changes you had made are also in the `main` branch.\r\n\r\n- [X] Now, we'll want to clean up since we are done with our `task_1` branch.\r\n  - IntelliJ: `Git -> branches... -> task_1 -> Delete`\r\n  - Terminal: `git branch -d task_1`\r\n\r\n- [] Last step, we'll push our changes to the remote repository to share our work! (As we did in Lab 1.)\r\n  - we suggest you check off this last item, commit that change (just right on main is fine;\r\n  no need to branch for this little step), then push your code. Check GitHub to ensure you can\r\n  see your changes.\r\n\r\nAnd that's it for Task 1! You might be wondering about how we are supposed to get someone else\r\nto review and approve our changes before we commit and push our changes to the main branch of\r\nour remote repository, since everything we just did was local. We'll explore how to do precisely\r\nthat by pushing our branch to our remote repository and making a pull request shortly, but first,\r\nwe'll talk about merge conflicts and how to resolve them.\r\n\r\nTip: In the Git tool window, you can open the `Console` tab to see the underlying git commands it\r\nis performing when you ask IntelliJ to perform various git operations for you.\r\n\r\n# TASK 2: Let's bake a cake!\r\n\r\nAlice and Bob are planning to bake a cake, but can't agree on which recipe to use. They had\r\nstarted working on the recipe in `recipe.md` together, and then each filled in the details of\r\nwhat they felt would make the most delicious cake!\r\nYou'll notice that your repository already has two branches called `alice` and `bob`.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Checkout the `alice` branch.\r\n- [ ] Attempt to merge the `bob` branch into the `alice` branch using either IntelliJ or the Terminal.\r\n  - You will be prompted to resolve a merge conflict. To do this, you will need to pick and choose which\r\n  parts of each recipe to keep.\r\n  - Read what either `git` or `IntelliJ` tells you in order to complete the merge process.\r\n    - If you do the merge through the Terminal, you will need to edit `recipe.md` to remove all of the\r\n    merge conflict symbols which `git` has added to your file. Once done, you will need to `git add` the\r\n    `recipe.md` file and `git commit` to finish the merge.\r\n- [ ] Once the merge is complete, delete the `bob` branch.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Finally, checkout the `main` branch and merge the `alice` branch in (as we did previously).\r\n\r\nNow, you are almost ready to share your recipe with the remote! \r\n\r\n# TASK 3\r\n\r\n- [ ] Checkout a new branch called `task_3`.\r\n- [ ] Commit any changes that you want to `recipe.md` to improve the recipe.\r\n- [ ] While still on the `task_3` branch, push your code to your remote repository on GitHub.\r\n- [ ] Go to GitHub and you will see an option to make a pull request to the original repo. Make\r\n  a pull request and see that it shows up in the original repository that you forked.\r\n\r\nSince others will also be making pull requests, we won't *actually* accept any of them for now, but\r\nyou'll get lots of practice with pull requests in the next task and throughout the rest of the course!\r\n\r\nWe're now ready to dive into a collaborative coding challenge.\r\n\r\nProceed to the second lab activity!\r\n\r\n## Hints and Tips\r\n\r\n### TASK 1 TODO: Hints\r\n- Hint 1: you only have to change one line of code\r\n- Hint 2: unlike Python, an int has a maximum value that it can store (see Integer.MAX_VALUE).\r\nalso see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html\r\n\r\n### TASK 2 (and possibly other places): Note about Unsaved local changes\r\n\r\nIf you have any local changes which you haven't committed, git will refuse to do certain operations\r\nwhich would result in the loss of your changes. It will advise you on what you should do in order to\r\nproceed. If you have any changes you want to keep, you will typically want to commit those changes.\r\n\r\nNote: you can use `git status` or `Git -> commit...` to see the status of your files to check which\r\nones have changes not yet committed.\r\n\r\n### TASK 3 Additional Note\r\n\r\nWhen making a pull request, there may potentially be merge conflicts to resolve, as we had seen in the\r\nprevious task. GitHub as additional information about how its interface helps facilitate resolving such\r\nconflicts:\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github
